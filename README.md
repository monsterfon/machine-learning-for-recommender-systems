# Machine Learning for Recommender Systems

This project contains a series of machine learning experiments focused on building recommender systems. It includes a total of **nine projects**, eight of which are related to machine learning, and the ninth dedicated to **data visualization**. These projects showcase various techniques for building effective recommender systems using real-world datasets.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Machine Learning Projects (8 Projects)
The first eight projects focus on machine learning and are implemented in **IPython notebooks**. These projects utilize popular libraries such as **Scikit-learn**, **PyTorch**, and other pre-built implementations of machine learning algorithms. The projects mainly cover:

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommending movies, products, and other items based on user interactions.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Using item features to recommend similar products or movies.
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining collaborative and content-based methods.
- **Matrix Factorization**: Techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for recommendation systems.

The datasets used primarily focus on recommender systems data, such as movie recommendations, product recommendations, and other personalized item suggestions.

### 2. Data Visualization Project (1 Project)
The ninth project is dedicated to **data visualization**. It focuses on visualizing various features and results of machine learning models, helping to understand patterns, correlations, and the effectiveness of different recommendation techniques.

## Technologies Used:
- **Scikit-learn** for classical machine learning models.
- **PyTorch** for deep learning-based models.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the IPython notebooks and run them sequentially.
3. Follow the steps to install the necessary libraries (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, etc.).
4. Analyze the results of different recommendation algorithms and visualize the data with the provided project.
